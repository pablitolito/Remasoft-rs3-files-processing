# Remasoft-rs3-files-processing
Set of four scripts (A1, A2, A3 and A4) for processing Remasoft *.rs3 files.


## A1.get_NRM-Components_fromRemasoft_v2024.py

### Overview
- This Python script processes subdirectories within a specified base directory, each containing `.rs3` files, and generates summaries of calculated components and NRM.  
- The script locates and reads `.rs3` files, extracting details of calculated components, their intensity, temperature or coercivity ranges, and NRM values. Summarized data is outputted in `.txt` files for easy access and analysis.

### Features
- **Traverse subdirectories**: Automatically locates `.rs3` files within subfolders.
- **Data extraction**: Extracts calculated component information and NRM values from each `.rs3` file.
- **Output files**:
  1. **`Summary_components_<DIRECTORY>.txt`**: Contains calculated component data for each specimen, including intensity, temperature or coercivity ranges, and corresponding NRM values.
  2. **`NRM_<DIRECTORY>.txt`**: Summarizes the intensity of the NRM and directional values for each specimen.

### Usage
1. Place this script in the root directory where the subdirectories containing `.rs3` files are located.
2. Run the script to automatically generate the summary `.txt` files in the script's directory.


## A2.mean_intensity_NRM-components_v2024.py

### Overview
This Python script calculates average values per site for parameters saved in tables created by the `A1.get_NRM-Components_fromRemasoft_v2024` script. It iterates through files in the directory, matching site names to compute the averages.

### Features
- **Automatic File Detection:** The script automatically finds files based on the beginning of the filename.
- **Temperature and Coercivity Handling:** Extracts and calculates mean values for temperature and coercivity from data rows.
- **Flexible Site Name Delimiter:** Users can customize the delimiter between site names and specimen names.
- **Output Generation:** Produces comma-separated files showing average values per site, including:
  - NRM component mean and standard deviation
  - Component mean and standard deviation and mean temperatures and coercivities

### Usage
To run the script:
1. Place it in the directory containing files generated by the `A1.get_NRM-Components_fromRemasoft_v2024` script.
2. Ensure the filenames begin correctly, as the script searches based on the start of each filename.
3. Adjust the `site_delimiter` variable if necessary. The default is `-`, but it can be modified according to your data format.

### Notes
- Filenames must remain unchanged; otherwise, the script will not find the files.
- If there is more than one component in the `Summary_Components` files, the script may mix the information. Clean the files beforehand without altering the comma-separated format.

## A3.NRM_histogram_log_v2024.py

### Overview
This Python script generates a frequency histogram of NRM (Natural Remanent Magnetization) intensity from comma-delimited tables named `NRM_DIRECTORY.txt`, created by the `A1.get_NRM-Components_fromRemasoft_v2024.py` script. It analyzes the NRM intensity data and provides both a histogram and a cumulative frequency curve.

### Features
- **Automatic File Detection:** The script searches the current directory for files starting with `NRM_` and ending with `.txt`.
- **Customizable Histogram Settings:** Users can modify the limits of the x-axis and the number of bins for the histogram by adjusting the `lim_inf_x`, `lim_sup_x`, and `bins` variables.
- **Cumulative Frequency Curve:** Displays a cumulative frequency curve alongside the histogram.
- **Quartile Visualization:** Includes vertical lines indicating the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles on the cumulative frequency curve.

### Usage
To run the script:
1. Place it in the directory containing the NRM files generated by `A1.get_NRM-Components_fromRemasoft_v2024.py`.
2. Ensure the files are named correctly, starting with `NRM_` and ending with `.txt`.
3. Adjust the `lim_inf_x`, `lim_sup_x`, and `bins` variables in the script to customize the histogram limits and bin count as needed. By default, the limits are set to the minimum and maximum NRM values with 50 bins.

## A4.ChRM_Int_Temp_histogram_log_v2024.py

### Overview

This Python script is designed to create frequency histograms representing ChRM intensity and unblocking temperatures. The code searches the current directory for files `Summary_Components_DIRECTORY.txt` generated by  `A1.get_NRM-Components_fromRemasoft_v2024.py`, which are comma-delimited tables.

### Features

- **Cumulative Frequency Curve Calculation**: Implements a function to compute the relative cumulative frequency curve (ECDF) for ChRM values.

- **Data Extraction**: Reads text files to extract ChRM intensity values and unblocking temperatures. Minimum and maximum temperature values are printed to the console.

- **Limits and Bins Configuration**: Allows users to adjust the lower and upper limits of the x-axis for histograms, as well as the number of bins. Temperature limits are automatically set in increments of 25 ÂºC.

- **Histogram Generation**:
  - ChRM intensity histogram displayed on a logarithmic scale.
  - Unblocking temperature histograms (tmin and tmax) plotted on the y-axis.

- **Statistical Visualization**: Displays minimum, maximum, and quartile values for ChRM intensity in the console, with vertical lines on the graph to indicate these quartiles.

- **Graph Export**: Generated graphs are saved as PDF and PNG files in the current directory.

### Usage

1. Place the `Summary_Components_DIRECTORY.txt` files in the same directory as this script.
2. Adjust the limits and number of bins if necessary by modifying the `lim_inf_x`, `lim_sup_x`, and `bins` variables in the code.
3. Run the script:
